\begin{equation}
score = (my\_moves) - (opponent\_moves)
\label{eq:1}
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline
	Match & Student vs & Result \\ \hline
	1 & Random & 17 to 3 \\
	2 & MM\_Null & 18 to 2 \\
	3 & MM\_Open & 12 to 8 \\
	4 & MM\_Improved & 15 to 5 \\
	5 & AB\_Null & 17 to 3 \\
	6 & AB\_Open & 14 to 6 \\
	7 & AB\_Improved & 16 to 4 \\ \hline\hline
	\multicolumn{3}{|l|}{Evaluating Student using equation \ref{eq:1}: 77.86\% } \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Equation \ref{eq:1} calculate different between available moves between player 1 (student) and player 2. Positive number ($score > 0 $ ) tells the student has more moves than the opponent. This give more condfident score for the student to win the game.


\begin{equation}
score = (my\_moves) - (2.0 \times opponent\_moves)
\label{eq:2}
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline
	Match & Student vs & Result \\ \hline
	1 & Random & 18 to 2 \\
	2 & MM\_Null & 20 to 0 \\
	3 & MM\_Open & 15 to 5 \\
	4 & MM\_Improved & 13 to 7 \\
	5 & AB\_Null & 19 to 1 \\
	6 & AB\_Open & 13 to 7 \\
	7 & AB\_Improved & 14 to 6 \\ \hline\hline
	\multicolumn{3}{|l|}{Evaluating Student using equation \ref{eq:2}: 80.00\% } \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Equation \ref{eq:2} calcualte the different between player 1 and player 2 available moves by doubling the available moves for the opponent. This make the score value negative (opponent has more moves) much quicker then the \ref{eq:1}. This makes the Player 1 (student) to make more aggresive moves twards wining the game, and lead to $80\%$ success.


\begin{equation}
score = distance(player1, player2)
\label{eq:3}
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline
	Match & Student vs & Result \\ \hline
	1 & Random & 20 to 0\\
	2 & MM\_Null & 18 to 2\\
	3 & MM\_Open & 14 to 6\\
	4 & MM\_Improved & 14 to 6\\
	5 & AB\_Null & 15 to 5\\
	6 & AB\_Open & 13 to 7\\
	7 & AB\_Improved & 10 to 10\\ \hline\hline
	\multicolumn{3}{|l|}{Evaluating Student using equation \ref{eq:3}: 74.29\% } \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Equation \ref{eq:3} calculate the distance between the two player locations. I am trying to make the player positions close to each other by calculating the distance between the player's position, and when then distance is greater than $2.0$, the make the distance value negative and use as the score value. This allows players to go after each other more aggressively when the distance getter bigger.
